            <p>The expense required to field a competitive indoor percussion ensemble grows every season. Quality transportation, meals, facilities, show design, and instruments are costly, and we do our very best to ensure that we provide a world-class experience for our students while keeping their tuition expense among the lowest in the activity.</p>
            <p>In order to help us keep tuition costs low, please consider making a donation via PayPal. Your donation is fully tax deductible and you can be assured that 100% of your donation will go to operating costs for the ensemble.</p>
